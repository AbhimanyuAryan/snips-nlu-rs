### `graph_logistic_regression.pb`

This model is a (binary) Logistic Regression `y = sigmoid(W * x)`, where
```
     .2
W =  .3
     .5
```
The input node is called `inputs`, the output node is called `logits`.

### `graph_multiclass_logistic_regression.pb`

This model is a multi-class (5 classes) Logistic Regression `y = softmax(W * x)`, where
```
      .2   .3   .5   .7  .11
W =  .13  .17  .19  .23  .29
     .31  .37  .41  .43  .47
```
The input node is called `inputs`, the output node is called `logits`.

### `graph_crf.pb`

This model is a Conditional Random Field (CRF). The unary potentials are a linear mapping of the inputs with parameter `W`, and transition matrix is `psi`, where
```
      .2   .3   .5   .7  .11
W =  .13  .17  .19  .23  .29
     .31  .37  .41  .43  .47

       20.  21.  22.  23.  24.
```
The input node is called `inputs`, the output node is called `logits` and the transition matrix node is called `psi`.
